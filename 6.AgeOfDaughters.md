# Age of daughters

The product of their age is 72.
Sum of their age is equal to house number.
Oldest girl like ice cream.

# Answer
We first find all factors of 72

1.1.72
1.2.36
1.3.24
1.4.18
1.6.12
1.8.9 -> 18
2.2.18
2.3.12 -> 17
2.4.9 -> 15
2.6.6 -> 14
3.4.6 -> 13
3.3.8 -> 14

We have two values, 2.6.6 and 3.3.8
whose sum is equal.

Since we cannot find the age of daughter with second hind, the third hint is imp.

he has an oldest daugher.
So, the answer is 3, 3, and 8.
