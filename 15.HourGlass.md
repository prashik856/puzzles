# Solution
4min 7min
0 3min -> After 4 minutes

Put 3min back in 7min, we don't measure it.
Start from scratch, reverse 4min and 7min again,
after 4 mins, we will have this:
0 3min -> After 8 minutes

Now, reverse both 3min, and 4min,
and let the sand flow
as soon as 3min is empty.
We stop, as 
one will have 1min, and other will have 7minutes stored in it.

Reverse both of them, and as 4min one is empty, we have 9 minutes.

# Their solution:
At 0 minutes: Start both hourglasses at the same time.
At 4 minutes: 4 minutes hourglass runs out and flip it. 7 minutes hourglass is left with 3 minutes.
At 7 minutes: 4 minutes hourglass is left with 1 minute. 7 minutes hourglass runs out and flip it.
At 8 minutes: 4 minutes hourglass runs out and 7 is filled with 6 minutes and 1 minute on the other side. Flip it as the sand is left with 1 minute.
At 9 minutes: 7 minutes hourglass becomes empty from above side.
