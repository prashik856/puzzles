# Solution
Distance = 0

Distance = 5000
Tyre 1 5000
Tyre 2 5000
Tyre 3 5000
Tyre 4 5000
Spare = 0

Distance = 10000
After this, we add spare tyre to tyre 1
Tyre1 5000
Tyre2 10000
Tyre3 10000
Tyre4 10000
Spare = 5000

Distance = 15000
Add Spare to Tyre 2
tyre1 = 10000
Tyre2 = 10000
Tyre3 = 15000
Tyre4 = 15000
Spare = 10000

Distance = 20000
Add Spare to Typre 3
Tyre1 = 15000
Tyre2 = 15000
Tyre3 = 15000
Tyre4 = 20000
Spare = 15000

Distance = 25000
Add Spare to Tyre 4
Tyre1 = 20000
Tyre2 = 20000
Tyre3 = 20000
Tyre4 = 20000
Spare = 20000

Max distance = 25,000
