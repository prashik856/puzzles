# Chocolate Bars

You have a bar of chocolate that consists of n x m square 
blocks.
If you can only break one piece at a time, 
how many breaks are necessary to break the original
n x m piece into n*m 1 x 1 pieces?


# Solution
The solution is always n*m-1.
We can solve this by checking first 2*2,
then 2*3, then 3*3.
The solution is always n*m - 1.
