# Distance travelled by bee

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-3-calculate-total-distance-travelled-by-bee/

Two trains are on same track and they are coming toward each other. The speed of the first train is 50 km/h and the speed of the second train is 70 km/h. A bee starts flying between the trains when the distance between two trains is 100 km. The bee first flies from first train to second train. Once it reaches the second train, it immediately flies back to the first train â€¦ and so on until trains collide. Calculate the total distance travelled by the bee. Speed of bee is 80 km/h. 

# Solution
We just need to find the time taken for two trans to collide.

if t is the time taken to collide,
disance travelled by bee = 80 km/h * time (in hours) = 80t km.
t = x1/50 + x2/70

x1 + x2 = 100
t1 + t2 = t
t1 = t/2
t2 = t/2
x1 = t1 * 50 = t/2 * 50 = 25t
x2 = 35t

25t + 35t = 100
t = 100/60 = 5/3

Distance by bee = 80 * (5/3) = 400/3 km.
