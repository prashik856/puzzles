# Torch And Bridge

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-18-torch-and-bridge/

There are 4 persons (A, B, C and D) who want to cross a bridge at night.

    A takes 1 minute to cross the bridge.
    B takes 2 minutes to cross the bridge.
    C takes 5 minutes to cross the bridge.
    D takes 8 minutes to cross the bridge.

There is only one torch with them and the bridge cannot be crossed without the torch. There cannot be more than two persons on the bridge at any time, and when two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower personâ€™s pace. 

Can they all cross the bridge in 15 minutes? 

Solution:
Optimal Solution 
First, 1 and 2 cross the bridge = 2 mins
1 comes back with torch = 1 min
5 and 8 cross the bridge = 8 min
2 comes back with torch = 2 min
1 and 2 cross the bridge = 2 mins
Total = 2 + 1 + 8 + 2 + 2 = 15mins.

Yes, they can cross.
