# How many ways

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-6x6-grid-how-many-ways/

You begin in the top left corner of a 6Ã—6 grid, and your objective is to move to the bottom right corner. There are just two directions you can move: right or down. Both diagonal and backward movements are prohibited. How many different ways are there to get from the start to the finish?

# Solution
We can see here that the number of paths from starting left point to the right ending is not depending on the way of the path, it depends on the number of rows and columns taken to reach the end. Whenever we face such kind of problem, where we have a choice to take or a fixed number of rows or columns to be taken in grid. We can think about mathematics in those cases. Here, we are going to use a mathematical concept, called combinatorics.

We need to use combinatorics here.


We know, nCk = n!/((n-k)! * k!)

For 2x2, matrix
1 1
1 1, we have 2 paths, and we can choose two ways
which is 2C1 =  = 2!/1!*1! = 2

For 3x3 matrix,
We will have, 
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1, We have 4 moves, and 2 rows or 2 columns choices,
4C2 = 4!/2! * 2! = 4*3/2 = 6 ways

For 4x4 matrix,
We will have 
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1, 6 moves, and 3 rows or 3 columns choices,
6c3 = 6!/3!*3! = 6.5.4/3.2 = 5.4 = 20

For 5x5,
We have 
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1, 8 moves, and 4 rows or column choices
8c4 = 2.7.5 = 70 ways

For 6x6
1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1, 10 moves, 5 rows or columns choices
10c5 = 2.9.2.7 = 4 * 9 * 7 = 36 * 7 = 252 ways

What will happen if I have 3 x 4
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1, 5 total, 3 columns, 2 rows

In actuality, 3 column moves, 2 row moves
5c3 = 5 * 2 = 10 ways of moving through columns
5c2 = 5 * 2 = 10 ways of moving through rows
Total = 10 ways?

1 1 1 1
3 moves, 3 columns, 0 rows
3c3 = 1 way
3c0 = 1 ways
Total = 1 way.
