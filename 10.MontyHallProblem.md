# Monty Hall Problem

Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Solution: There are two cases here :
    Switching
    Not switching

Before we choose anything, 
Probability of winning car is 1/3.
As the car can be behind any door in random.

When the host has reveiled us that a goat is present in one a selected door.
The probability of getting a goat in of the doors is, 2/3.
So, probability of winning car is 2/3.
When we are switching, as we have higher probability of knowing where the goat is.

Not Switching,
So probability of selecting a door which has a car is 1/3 as 1 door out of 3 has car. Therefore probability of winning a car by not switching is 1/3.

As probability of winning a car by switching is higher than not switching. It is advantage to switch.
